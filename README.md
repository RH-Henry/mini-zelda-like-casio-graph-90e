# mini-zelda-like-casio-graph-90e
mini zelda like casio graph 90+e (and other prizm but you'll need to change some code for now.)


## Installation:
Got to projects/Zelda, download Zelda.g3a and paste it to the root of your calculator.
If you have white screen, download the entire project, go to include/spritedef.h, open it and change all 0xAC000000 to 0xA8000000. Then save it, go to projects/Zelda and open Make.bat. You will be able to download the game.

## Code
For now there's 2 code files, projects/zelda.c and includes/spritedef.h
You can modify and sell code if you want but ask to Nintendo.
